# Sales predictions project

Purpose of the project: To predict the sales using the data given by the outlets and
 train models implementing the knowledge 
which was obtained during the bootcamp at Coding Dojo.

 Project was initially designed to increase the sales by reducing prediction error 

Porject consists of 5 parts:
1. Data cleaning
2. Data visualization
3. Data Exploratory
4. Pre-processing to machine models
5. Running the models
## ðŸ›  Skills
**Python programming language , Machine Learning tools**

  **Libraries: Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy** 

 **Parameters:**
 Train_test_split, 
 DecisionTreeRegressor,
 LinearRegression,
R2_score, mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error,
BaggingRegressor,
RandomForest


## Overall information

**Part 1**
Data Cleaning:

1) Dropped any duplicates.

2) Identified missing values.

3) Decided on how to address the missing values and do it

4) Confirmed that there are no missing values after addressing them.

5) Found and fixed any inconsistent categories of data

6) For any numerical columns, obtained the summary statistics of each (min, max, mean)


**Part 2**
Data visualization:

Plotted Histogram to view the distributions of various features in your dataset.

Boxplot to view statistical summaries of various features in your dataset.

Heatmap of the correlation between features

**Part 3**
Data exploratory:

Obtained the important data about 
the sales based on outlet types and item types by plotting some illustrations

**Part 4**
Pre-processing into machine learning:

Imported important tools and libraries

Made ready train and test split

Did fit into the model

Assigned features and target variables

Used get_dummy method to make it ready to run the model

**Part 5**
Running the model:

Run 4 different models

Calculated r2 scores of train and test scores

Compared the prediction error between the models

Identified which model parameter works best for the project



  
## Results

**1. Made significant conclusions based on sales predictions dataset**

**2. Shared with my Recommendation**

**3. Identified which model works best for the project**

**4. Reduced the prediction error by almost 45%**

**5. Achieved less coding, and more analysis research**
